# CLAUDE.md — Agent Self-Reference

Workspace: `D:\0-Nouslogic\AmazingHand-ARM101-Follower`
Hardware: SO-ARM101 follower arm (5 STS3215 motors, gripper removed) + AmazingHand bionic hand (8 SCS0009 motors). Single-PC dev (no embedded board, no cross-compile). Loaded automatically by Claude Code.

---

## 1. Project TL;DR

A unified workspace for calibrating and controlling two robotic devices that share one Python process:

- **SO-ARM101 follower** — LeRobot's 6-DoF arm with the gripper (motor ID 6) physically removed. The AmazingHand mounts in its place. We subclass `SOFollower` to skip the missing motor and register a new robot type, `so101_follower_no_gripper`.
- **AmazingHand** — Pollen Robotics 4-finger bionic hand (4 fingers × 2 SCS0009 = 8 servos). Driven via the `rustypot` Python wheel (Rust + pyo3 binding).

Both devices live behind separate USB↔TTL bridges on different COM ports and different voltage rails (5 V hand, 12 V arm). They are coordinated only at the application layer (a future teleop / policy script).

## 2. Iron Laws TL;DR

Full text in `docs/conventions/00-iron-laws.md`. Read that file before editing.

- **IL-1 — Voltage isolation is physical safety.** 5 V hand bus and 12 V arm bus must never share rails. Mixing destroys SCS0009 instantly.
- **IL-2 — `references/` is read-only.** Five vendored submodules (lerobot, AmazingHand, FeetechServo, rustypot, FTServo_Python). Adapt by transferring into `src/` or `scripts/`.
- **IL-3 — Motor ID canon.** Hand: IDs 1–8 (odd-right/even-left per finger). Arm: IDs 1–5 shoulder→wrist. **ID 6 is physically absent on the arm.**
- **IL-4 — COM-port discipline.** Single owner per bus. Close FD.exe / serial monitors / stale Python sessions before opening.
- **IL-5 — Project state in version control, in-tree only.** Calibration — Hand: `scripts/calibration/amazing_hand/hand_calib_values.yaml`. Arm: `scripts/calibration/so_arm101/<id>.json` — the `SO101FollowerNoGripperConfig` subclass defaults `calibration_dir` to that path so `~/.cache/huggingface/lerobot/...` is never written to. Runtime operator config (connection/safety/tuning/poses) — `src/arm101_hand/data/{arm,hand}_config.yaml`.
- **IL-6 — Atomic cross-device commits.** Changes touching both arm and hand ship in one commit.
- **IL-7 — Documentation is single-source-of-truth.** One canonical home per fact; pointers everywhere else.

## 5. Convention files

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `docs/conventions/00-iron-laws.md` | **Read first.** Non-negotiable invariants. |
| `docs/conventions/01-module-layering.md` | Where code goes; the four import invariants. |
| `docs/conventions/02-code-style-python.md` | Python 3.12 style; ruff/mypy config; pydantic patterns. |
| `docs/conventions/03-code-style-shell.md` | PowerShell (primary) + Bash (rare). |
| `docs/conventions/04-testing-verification.md` | Test pyramid; `@pytest.mark.hardware` for bus-required tests. |
| `docs/conventions/05-git-workflow.md` | Branches, commit format, atomic cross-device commit rule. |
| `docs/conventions/06-documentation-protocol.md` | When to refresh CLAUDE.md/README.md; DRY registry. |
| `docs/conventions/07-kiss-simplicity.md` | KISS — prefer the simplest design that satisfies the requirement + Iron Laws. |

## 6. Don'ts (compressed)

- **Don't modify `references/**`** — IL-2. Adapt by transferring into `src/` or `scripts/`.
- **Don't share power rails between hand and arm** — IL-1. Two PSUs, two cables, labeled.
- **Don't run `lerobot-calibrate` directly for the follower** — it doesn't know `so101_follower_no_gripper`. Use `arm101-calibrate-follower`.
- **Don't open a COM port from two processes** — IL-4. Close other holders first.
- **Don't hand-edit calibration YAML/JSON while a controller is connected** — IL-5. Re-run the calibration script.
- **Don't use `yaml.load()`** — `yaml.safe_load()` only.
- **Don't `subprocess.*` without `timeout=`** — see `02-code-style-python.md` §8.
- **Don't commit secrets** — `~/.cache/huggingface/token` lives outside the repo.

## 7. Tech-debt & known limitations

- **No teleop, no policy, no dataset code.** The jog / calibration / diagnostic scripts drive poses; no teleoperation or learned-policy path yet.
- **No CI.** `ruff` / `pytest` are local-only for now.
- **No discrete GPU.** Local ML training is CPU-bound; large-policy work needs cloud.
