# CLAUDE.md — Agent Self-Reference

Workspace: `D:\0-Nouslogic\AmazingHand-ARM101-Follower`
Hardware: SO-ARM101 follower arm (5 STS3215 motors, gripper removed) + AmazingHand bionic hand (8 SCS0009 motors). Single-PC dev (no embedded board, no cross-compile). Loaded automatically by Claude Code.

---

## 1. Project TL;DR

A unified workspace for calibrating and controlling two robotic devices that share one Python process:

- **SO-ARM101 follower** — LeRobot's 6-DoF arm with the gripper (motor ID 6) physically removed. The AmazingHand mounts in its place. We subclass `SOFollower` to skip the missing motor and register a new robot type, `so101_follower_no_gripper`.
- **AmazingHand** — Pollen Robotics 4-finger bionic hand (4 fingers × 2 SCS0009 = 8 servos). Driven via the `rustypot` Python wheel (Rust + pyo3 binding).

Both devices live behind separate USB↔TTL bridges on different COM ports and different voltage rails (5 V hand, 12 V arm). They are coordinated only at the application layer (a future teleop / policy script).

## 2. Iron Laws TL;DR

Full text in `docs/conventions/00-iron-laws.md`. Read that file before editing.

- **IL-1 — Voltage isolation is physical safety.** 5 V hand bus and 12 V arm bus must never share rails. Mixing destroys SCS0009 instantly.
- **IL-2 — `references/` is read-only.** Vendored git submodules — core: lerobot, AmazingHand, rustypot, FeetechServo, FTServo_Python; plus camera + computer-vision references. Adapt by transferring into `src/` or `scripts/`.
- **IL-3 — Motor ID canon.** Hand: IDs 1–8 (odd-right/even-left per finger). Arm: IDs 1–5 shoulder→wrist. **ID 6 is physically absent on the arm.**
- **IL-4 — COM-port discipline.** Single owner per bus. Close FD.exe / serial monitors / stale Python sessions before opening.
- **IL-5 — Project state in version control, in-tree only.** Calibration — Hand: `scripts/calibration/amazing_hand/hand_calib_values.yaml`. Arm: `scripts/calibration/so_arm101/<id>.json` — the `SO101FollowerNoGripperConfig` subclass defaults `calibration_dir` to that path so `~/.cache/huggingface/lerobot/...` is never written to. Runtime operator config (connection/safety/tuning/poses) — `src/arm101_hand/data/{arm,hand}_config.yaml`.
- **IL-6 — Atomic cross-device commits.** Changes touching both arm and hand ship in one commit.
- **IL-7 — Documentation is single-source-of-truth.** One canonical home per fact; pointers everywhere else.

## 6. Don'ts (compressed)

- **Don't modify `references/**`** — IL-2. Adapt by transferring into `src/` or `scripts/`.
- **Don't share power rails between hand and arm** — IL-1. Two PSUs, two cables, labeled.
- **Don't run `lerobot-calibrate` directly for the follower** — it doesn't know `so101_follower_no_gripper`. Use `arm101-calibrate-follower`.
- **Don't open a COM port from two processes** — IL-4. Close other holders first.
- **Don't hand-edit calibration YAML/JSON while a controller is connected** — IL-5. Re-run the calibration script.
- **Don't use `yaml.load()`** — `yaml.safe_load()` only.
- **Don't `subprocess.*` without `timeout=`** — see `02-code-style-python.md` §8.
- **Don't commit secrets** — `~/.cache/huggingface/token` lives outside the repo.

## 7. Tech-debt & known limitations

- **No teleop, no policy, no dataset code.** The jog / calibration / diagnostic scripts drive poses; no teleoperation or learned-policy path yet.
- **System-camera preview + DR-grading inference are the computer-vision code so far.** `src/arm101_hand/system_camera/` (cv2 HighGUI window + recording, plus a "last capture" still popup the same thread hosts via `WebcamPreview.show_still`) films the Aurora screen; used by `grab_trigger_capture` + `usb_camera_probe`. The screen ROI now lives in `system_camera_config.yaml` (`screen_roi`, read via `roi_from_region`; `roi.py`'s `AURORA_SCREEN_ROI` is only the fallback default) as a **deskewed 5:3 (800x480) crop** — `screen_roi` carries a rotation `angle` so a slightly-tilted screen comes out upright (`Roi.crop` rotates about the box centre when `angle != 0`, plain-slice fast path otherwise), and `imshow_fit` letterboxes to preserve aspect ratio because `cv2.WINDOW_KEEPRATIO` is a silent no-op on this wheel's Win32 highgui backend. The `screen_roi` (with its angle), the two symmetric alignment-arc bands, and the red HSV band are all re-derived by `scripts/calibration/system_camera/calibrate_view.py` from **3 captures (white startup -> red arcs -> bright/aligned screen)**: the white frame is the drag-and-rotate backdrop for the deskewed 5:3 screen_roi (manual box + arrow-key rotation), the two arc boxes are dragged by hand on the deskewed ROI, and the red HSV band + coverage threshold are auto-swept against a RED + CLEAR reference panel (hue POOLED across ALL labelled red frames, a low coverage floor, pick_threshold = max-margin when separable / min-misclassification when not, and transitional one-arc-blank 'red' frames excluded from the fit + reported) then refined by an arc-debug-style test loop that re-sweeps over operator-labelled frames -- all inside the staged robot grab (run_grab_demo) that brings the camera to the Aurora screen; interactive confirm + comment-preserving ruamel writer, pure detection math in `system_camera/calibration.py`, run after any resolution or lighting change. Focus is locked to a fixed manual value (`system_camera_config.yaml` `autofocus: false` / `focus: 600`, applied in `open_capture` via `_apply_focus`) so the fixed-geometry Aurora screen stays sharp instead of autofocus hunting/breathing — this **requires `backend: dshow`** (MSMF accepts the focus calls but doesn't drive the VCM); the value was found with `usb_camera_focus_probe.py` (sharpness math in `focus.py`). It needs the full `opencv-python` wheel, so `pyproject.toml` drops lerobot's `opencv-python-headless` pin via `[tool.uv] override-dependencies` — keep that override (a headless-pinning dep re-clobbers `cv2`). The newest CV piece is the **arc auto-trigger**, now **red-only + red->not-red gated**: `arc_detector.detect` classifies each of the two on-screen alignment arcs as RED (>= `coverage_threshold` red HSV coverage) or not (the bright/aligned screen reads greenish and unreliable, so only red is thresholded), and `auto_trigger.update` is a pure clock-injected gated lifecycle `WAIT_RED -> WAIT_CLEAR -> STABILIZING -> COOLDOWN`: a fire requires BOTH arcs RED (misaligned, the per-capture gate) THEN BOTH not-red (aligned) held `stable_seconds`, then cooldown, then re-require red — a blank/menu/already-aligned screen never passes the gate (no false fire). Both feed `grab_auto_trigger_analysis` (multi-shot per patient, 'g' grades, 'n' next) via `WebcamPreview.latest_frame` + a status overlay (HUD shows L/R red/clear + the phase), config in the `system_camera_config.yaml` `auto_trigger` block (`left_arc`/`right_arc`/`red_bands`/`coverage_threshold`/timing; `schema_version` 7), design/plan in `docs/superpowers/{specs,plans}/2026-06-23-system-camera-deskew-circle-redgate*` (supersedes the 2026-06-19 + 2026-06-22 arc geometry/logic). To collect frames where the RED/clear classification misbehaves (for retuning `coverage_threshold` / `red_bands` / arc geometry), `scripts/diagnostics/system_camera/usb_camera_arc_debug.py` stages the grab, draws the arc boxes on the live deskewed ROI, and SPACE-saves a clean+annotated frame + a numbers sidecar to `media_outputs/arc_debug/` (no Aurora, no trigger; design/plan in `docs/superpowers/{specs,plans}/2026-06-23-system-camera-arc-debug-diagnostic*`). The vendored `references/computer-vision/` (OpenCV, MediaPipe, GazeTracking) is still untouched, for planned gaze work.
- **DR grading is inference-only.** `src/arm101_hand/fundus_analysis/` grades Aurora captures with a RETFound ViT-L/16 (timm) fine-tuned on APTOS2019 via two entry points: the batch CLI `arm101-dr-grade` (Phase 1) and inline grading in the `grab_trigger_capture_analysis` demo (Phase 2 — grades each patient turn on 'g', shows a combined results panel beside the image, writes identical `.dr.json` sidecars); `grab_trigger_capture` stays capture-only. Design/plan in `docs/superpowers/{specs,plans}/2026-06-11-dr-grading-*`. Pipeline validated on the APTOS test split (quadratic-weighted kappa 0.91 — see `scripts/fundus_analysis/README.md` for the full metrics). No fine-tuning path. Domain shift (APTOS/EyePACS training vs Optomed Aurora handheld) means real-capture accuracy can drop below test-split numbers — research/educational, not diagnostic.
- **Aurora has two independent, fixed idle-power timers — an API keep-alive does NOT prevent sleep.** Per the User Manual (p.20, no menu setting to disable/lengthen): SCREEN power-save at 2 minutes idle, full POWER-OFF at 10 minutes idle, woken only "by using any control button" (a physical press); the charging cradle forces power save (p.18), so the camera must be lifted off it for use. Bench probe `scripts/diagnostics/fundus_camera/aurora_keepalive_probe.py --duration 720` (PING_CAMERA every 15 s, run 2026-06-23) confirmed the API stayed RESPONSIVE from 0 to ~9:10 (well past the 2-minute mark), then the first ping failed at +565.8 s and the device went undiscoverable by +634.8 s — consistent with the documented 10-minute power-off. Interpretation: TWO power domains — the 2-minute timer sleeps only the SCREEN (Wi-Fi + Pictor API stay up, which is why pings kept succeeding for ~9 minutes), while the 10-minute timer powers OFF the whole device and is NOT reset by API traffic. Consequence for future work: a software heartbeat / keep-alive is a no-op against the 10-minute power-off (and unneeded for the 2-10 minute window, where the API stays up on its own). To keep the camera available: keep it OFF the cradle, keep inter-use gaps under ~10 minutes, and wake/power it via a PHYSICAL control button (the robot's physical shutter press counts as a control button — it wakes the screen). In `grab_auto_trigger_analysis.py` the on-screen alignment arcs cannot be detected while the screen is asleep (>2 minutes idle), so the screen must be woken before AUTO can fire. A sleep-recovery feature (bounded reconnect-wait at the capture boundary + operator guidance, no automatic arm/hand wake motion) is DESIGNED but DEFERRED — only the constraint is recorded here.
- **CI runs lint + tests only — never hardware.** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs ruff format-check + ruff lint + mypy(src) + pytest (`not hardware`) on every push/PR (Ubuntu, Python 3.12; only the `lerobot` submodule is initialized). `update-submodules.yml` bumps the public reference submodules weekly (excludes `lerobot` and the private `nous_vclient`, which the runner token cannot reach). Bus-required tests stay bench-only.
- **No discrete GPU.** Local ML training is CPU-bound; ViT-L inference runs on CPU (~2-5 s/image); large-policy work needs cloud.
