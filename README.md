# AmazingHand + SO-ARM101 Follower

Unified Python workspace for calibrating and controlling a **LeRobot SO-ARM101 follower arm** with the gripper replaced by a **Pollen Robotics AmazingHand** bionic hand. Single-PC development on Windows 11 — no embedded board, no cross-compile.

## What it is

- A 5-DoF arm + 4-finger bionic hand sharing one Python process.
- Two independent serial buses: **5 V** for the hand (8 × Feetech SCS0009), **12 V** for the arm (5 × Feetech STS3215, no gripper).
- Calibration scripts that produce version-controlled state, ready for downstream teleop / policy work.

The arm side is a thin layer over [`huggingface/lerobot`](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot) — we subclass `SOFollower` to skip the physically-absent gripper motor (ID 6) and register the new type as `so101_follower_no_gripper`. The hand side uses [`pollen-robotics/rustypot`](https://github.com/pollen-robotics/rustypot) directly through its Python wheel.

## Hardware

Full bill of materials, current budgets, and host PC spec live in [`docs/BOM.md`](docs/BOM.md). Quick summary:

| Role | Part | Qty | Bus |
|---|---|---|---|
| Arm actuators | Feetech STS3215 (12 V) | 5 (IDs 1–5) | Waveshare Bus Servo Adapter (A) |
| Arm power | 12 V / 3 A DC | 1 | — |
| Hand actuators | Feetech SCS0009 (5 V) | 8 (IDs 1–8) | Seeed XIAO Bus Servo Driver |
| Hand power | 5 V / 3 A DC | 1 | — |
| USB↔TTL bridge (hand) | Waveshare CH343 (VID 1A86 / PID 55D3) | 1 | enumerates as `COM18` on the dev host |
| USB↔TTL bridge (arm) | Waveshare adapter (CH343 / FT232 typical) | 1 | discover with PnP query below |

**The 5 V and 12 V rails must never share** — mixing destroys SCS0009 servos instantly. See `docs/conventions/00-iron-laws.md` IL-1.

## Host setup

You'll need:

- **Windows 10/11** (developed on Windows 11 Home build 22635).
- **Python 3.12** (declared in `.python-version`; the Microsoft Store install or `https://www.python.org/downloads/` is fine).
- **`uv`** package manager — install per [`https://github.com/astral-sh/uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv).

From a fresh clone:

```powershell
git clone --recurse-submodules <this-repo-url>
cd AmazingHand-ARM101-Follower
uv sync
```

`uv sync` provisions `.venv/` from `pyproject.toml` (lerobot[feetech] editable from the submodule, rustypot wheel, numpy, pyyaml, pydantic). About 60 packages get installed including `torch` — first sync takes a few minutes.

You do **not** need to activate the venv. Use `uv run <command>` for everything.

## First commands

### 1. Discover your COM ports

```powershell
Get-PnpDevice -Class Ports -Status OK | Select-Object Name, DeviceID | Format-Table -AutoSize
```

Note the COM number for each USB↔TTL bridge. On the dev host the AmazingHand bridge is `COM18`; the SO-ARM101 bridge gets a separate number.

Alternatively, lerobot's interactive port helper:

```powershell
uv run python scripts/calibration/so_arm101/find_port.py
```

### 2. AmazingHand finger calibration

Full procedure (5 steps: ID burn → 0° reset → middle-position tuning → range-limit calibration → audit) is in [`scripts/calibration/AmazingHand/README.md`](scripts/calibration/AmazingHand/README.md). After the first ID-burn step (one-time, with FD.exe), the Python flow is:

```powershell
uv run python scripts/calibration/AmazingHand/AmazingHand_MotorReset.py
uv run python scripts/calibration/AmazingHand/AmazingHand_MiddlePos_FingerCalib.py
uv run python scripts/calibration/AmazingHand/AmazingHand_RangeCalib.py
uv run python scripts/calibration/AmazingHand/AmazingHand_FingerTest.py
```

All state lives in `scripts/calibration/AmazingHand/AmazingHand_calib_values.yaml`.

### 3. SO-ARM101 follower calibration

Full procedure in [`scripts/calibration/so_arm101/README.md`](scripts/calibration/so_arm101/README.md). Quick form:

```powershell
uv run arm101-calibrate-follower `
    --robot.type=so101_follower_no_gripper `
    --robot.port=COM<X> `
    --robot.id=so101_follower
```

Replace `COM<X>` with the COM number from step 1. The output JSON goes to `scripts/calibration/so_arm101/so101_follower.json` — the `SO101FollowerNoGripperConfig` subclass defaults `calibration_dir` to that in-tree location, so the upstream `~/.cache/huggingface/lerobot/...` path is never used (IL-5). Pass `--robot.calibration_dir=<path>` if you want to override.

> **Important.** Use `arm101-calibrate-follower` (defined in `pyproject.toml`), not `lerobot-calibrate`. The upstream entry point doesn't know our `so101_follower_no_gripper` subclass exists.
