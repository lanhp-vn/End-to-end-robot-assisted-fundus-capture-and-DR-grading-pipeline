"""
AmazingHand Set-Pose Utility

Drives the whole 4-finger AmazingHand to a single static pose -- ``open`` (full
extension) or ``close`` (full flexion) -- and holds it there under torque until
you press Enter, then releases. Unlike the test scripts it does not cycle; it
just parks the hand in one position.

Both poses are taken from the per-finger ``limits`` in
``AmazingHand_calib_values.yaml`` (measured at Step 4 with
``AmazingHand_RangeCalib.py``):

  * open  -> every finger at ``base_min``, neutral spread (side = 0)
  * close -> every finger at ``base_max``, neutral spread (side = 0)

Usage:
  uv run python scripts/calibration/AmazingHand/AmazingHand_SetPose.py open
  uv run python scripts/calibration/AmazingHand/AmazingHand_SetPose.py close
  uv run python scripts/calibration/AmazingHand/AmazingHand_SetPose.py   # prompts
