# AmazingHand — Finger Calibration (Python)

Calibration procedure for the 4-finger AmazingHand using the scripts in `scripts/calibration/amazing_hand/`. Follows the *Step 3: Finger calibration with Python* section of `references/AmazingHand/docs/AmazingHand_Assembly.pdf` (pages 21–23), with the manual middle-position tuning replaced by the YAML-driven scripts in this repo.

---

## 1. Overview

- 4 fingers × 2 Feetech **SCS0009** servos = 8 servos on a shared TTL serial bus @ 1 Mbaud.
- Each finger is a **parallel mechanism**: the two servos combine to produce flexion/extension + abduction/adduction. They must be driven as a pair.
- All calibration state lives in a single YAML file — `scripts/calibration/amazing_hand/hand_calib_values.yaml` — that every script reads from and writes to.
- Servo-ID convention (right hand, viewing from the palm side as in PDF page 21): **odd ID on the right servo, even ID on the left servo**.
  | Finger | Right servo (odd) | Left servo (even) |
  | ------ | ----------------- | ----------------- |
  | Index  | 1                 | 2                 |
  | Middle | 3                 | 4                 |
  | Ring   | 5                 | 6                 |
  | Thumb  | 7                 | 8                 |

## 2. Prerequisites

### 2.1 Python environment

The repo uses `uv` to manage a single virtualenv at `.venv/`. The AmazingHand scripts share that env with the SO-ARM101 follower code — there is no separate install step for the calibration scripts.

From the repo root:

```powershell
uv sync
```

`uv sync` provisions `.venv` from `pyproject.toml` (Python 3.12, lerobot[feetech], rustypot, numpy, pyyaml, pydantic). Re-run it whenever `pyproject.toml` changes.

Run any calibration script with `uv run`:

```powershell
uv run python scripts/calibration/amazing_hand/finger_test.py
```

`uv run` resolves the interpreter and PYTHONPATH from `.venv/`, so you do not need to activate the env first.

### 2.2 USB↔TTL bridge & COM port

The Waveshare CH343 bridge enumerates as a COM port on Windows. On this machine it's `COM18`. The port is stored in `src/arm101_hand/data/hand_config.yaml` under `connection.port` — edit that file if the port changes. Discover a changed port with:

```powershell
Get-PnpDevice -Class Ports -Status OK | Select-Object Name, DeviceID | Format-Table -AutoSize
```

### 2.3 Power

External **5 V / 2 A+** PSU wired to the servo bus hub. The USB bridge carries signal only — it cannot power 8 SCS0009s.

---

## 3. Calibration flow

Six steps, in order. Steps 2–5 all read from and/or update `hand_calib_values.yaml`.

### Step 1 — Burn unique IDs 1–8 with FD.exe

**Tool:** `references/FeetechServo/feetech debug tool master/FD1.9.8.2/FD.exe` (PDF page 21).

Factory default for every SCS0009 is ID `1`. Program each servo individually, one at a time, so duplicate IDs never share the bus.

1. Close any Python / serial-monitor windows holding the COM port.
2. PSU off. Disconnect all servos, then wire **exactly one** to the bus.
3. PSU on.
4. Launch `FD.exe` → **Programming** tab → set **Com = COM18**, **BaudR = 1000000** → click **Open**.
5. Click **Search** — the servo appears as ID 1.
6. Edit **address 5 ("ID")** to the target value (1..8) per the table in §1.
7. Click **Save** (next to the ID input box). Without Save the change is lost on power cycle.
8. Click **Search** again — same servo should now report the new ID.
9. Click **Close**, PSU off, swap to the next servo, repeat.

> **IMPORTANT — Right vs left matters.** Mis-assigning odd/even on a pair means `FingerCalib`'s Close/Open direction is inverted for that finger. Label each servo as you program it (thin marker on the body), and verify orientation against PDF page 21 before screwing anything together.

When all 8 are burned, wire them all back to the bus and PSU on.

### Step 2 — Reset motors to 0° before attaching horns

**Script:** `scripts/calibration/amazing_hand/motor_reset.py`
**Replaces:** PDF page 22 ("Place servo horns as following picture").

Each servo needs to be sitting at its electrical 0° when the horn is screwed down — otherwise the finger's neutral pose is mechanically wrong and no software offset can fix it.

1. Make sure **no servo horns are attached yet**.
2. Run the script (`uv run python scripts/calibration/amazing_hand/motor_reset.py`), type `yes` at the confirmation.
3. At `Which finger to reset? (index/middle/ring/thumb, 'q' to quit):`, enter a finger.
4. The script drives that finger's two servos to 0°, holds them under torque, and sets the finger's `middle_pos` values to `0` in the YAML.
5. Fit each horn onto the spline as close to the matching position on PDF page 22 as the geometry allows, then secure with the **M2×4 servo screw**.
6. Pick the next finger at the same prompt. Repeat for all four.
7. Type `q` — torque releases on all touched motors.

### Step 3 — Fine-tune middle positions

**Script:** `scripts/calibration/amazing_hand/middle_calib.py`
**Follows:** PDF page 23.

Horn splines have discrete teeth (~15° each), so even a well-installed horn has a few degrees of residual offset. Dial it in interactively.

1. Run the script (`uv run python scripts/calibration/amazing_hand/middle_calib.py`), enter a finger at the prompt.
2. The finger runs one Close→Open cycle, then:
   ```
   New MiddlePos_1 [current=0] (Enter to keep, 'save'/'q' to exit):
   ```
3. **Watch the CLOSED pose** — both servo horns should be aligned with the servo's middle plane (the seam line across the servo body; see PDF page 23 photo). If a horn sits a few degrees short or past that line, enter an integer degree offset. Press Enter to keep the other servo unchanged.
4. Next cycle reflects the new values. Iterate until both horns sit on the middle plane at full close.
5. Type `save` (or `q`, or Ctrl+C) when done — values persist to the YAML, and only the active finger's entry changes.
6. Re-run for each of the other three fingers.

> If a final offset is outside **±20°**, the horn is on the wrong spline tooth — repeat Step 2 for that finger, bumping the horn by one tooth.

### Step 4 — Calibrate per-finger motion limits

**Script:** `scripts/calibration/amazing_hand/range_calib.py`

Each finger's reachable envelope (how far it flexes/extends and how far it
spreads) is measured here and stored as logical-frame `base`/`side` min/max in
`hand_calib_values.yaml`. This is the hand's analog of the SO-ARM101
follower's `range_min`/`range_max` sweep. Torque stays **ON** the whole time; you
jog the finger to each mechanical stop with the arrow keys and mark the limit
there. The numbers in the YAML before you run are placeholder seeds — Step 4 is
where they become real.

> **Windows-only.** Uses `msvcrt` for raw arrow-key reads, so it must be run in
> a real Windows console (PowerShell / cmd), **not** Git Bash, WSL, or an IDE
> "run" pane that doesn't forward raw keystrokes.

#### 4.1 What the two DOF mean (sign convention)

`base` and `side` are the finger's **logical** degrees of freedom, measured in
degrees relative to the calibrated middle (`0, 0`) you dialed in at Step 3:

- **`base`** — flexion. **Positive = closing/curling in**, negative = extending
  open. The `↑` key increases `base` (closes), `↓` decreases it (opens).
- **`side`** — abduction/spread. `→` increases `side`, `←` decreases it.

So the four stored limits map to four physical extremes:

| Limit      | Reached by jogging…                  | Mark key |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `base_max` | `↑` until the finger is fully closed | `2`    |
| `base_min` | `↓` until the finger is fully open   | `1`    |
| `side_max` | `→` to the spread stop               | `4`    |
| `side_min` | `←` to the opposite spread stop      | `3`    |

#### 4.2 Before you start

- Steps 1–3 are complete for this finger (IDs burned, horns on, middle dialed
  in). Step 4 reads each finger's `middle_pos` and jogs relative to it — a bad
  middle makes the measured limits meaningless.
- Close any other COM-port holder — FD.exe, serial monitors, a stale Python
  session (IL-4). Only one process may own the bus.
- 5 V PSU on; bus wired; correct `connection.port` in `src/arm101_hand/data/hand_config.yaml`.

#### 4.3 Run it

```powershell
uv run python scripts/calibration/amazing_hand/range_calib.py
```

1. At `Which finger to range-calibrate? (index/middle/ring/thumb):`, type a
   finger name and press Enter. The script enables torque on that finger's two
   servos and drives it to calibrated middle `(base=0, side=0)`. It prints the
   current stored limits so you can see what you're about to overwrite.
2. The full control map is printed at startup. The keys:

   | Key                     | Action                                                         |
   | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | `↑` / `↓`           | `base +` / `base −` — flex toward close / extend toward open |
   | `→` / `←`           | `side +` / `side −` — spread each way                       |
   | `[` / `]`           | shrink / grow the jog step (starts 5°, clamped 1–15°)        |
   | `1` `2` `3` `4` | mark `base_min` / `base_max` / `side_min` / `side_max` at the cursor |
   | `h`                   | home — snap the cursor back to `(0, 0)`                       |
   | `s`                   | save this finger's limits to the YAML now                      |
   | `q` / Ctrl+C          | save (if valid) and exit; torque off                           |

3. After every key the script prints a live status line:

   ```
   base=  35  side=   0  step= 5  load=[12,9]
   ```

   `base`/`side` are the cursor in degrees, `step` is the current jog increment,
   and `load=[L1,L2]` is each servo's present load. Watch `load` as you approach
   a stop.

4. **Marking a limit captures the cursor's current value — it does not move the
   finger.** So the workflow for each extreme is: *jog there, confirm it's at the
   stop, then press the mark key.* A recommended order for one finger:
   1. `↑ … ↑` to the closed stop → press `2` (`base_max`).
   2. `h` to re-home, then `↓ … ↓` to the open stop → press `1` (`base_min`).
   3. `h`, then `→ … →` to one spread stop → press `4` (`side_max`).
   4. `h`, then `← … ←` to the other spread stop → press `3` (`side_min`).

   Use `[` / `]` to drop to a 1–2° step for fine approach near a stop, and a
   bigger step to cross the open middle quickly.

5. **Mark just *before* the mechanical stop, not into it.** When you push into a
   hard stop the servos stall and you'll see:

   ```
   WARNING: high load on servo(s) [1] — back off one step and mark there
   ```

   That means back off one jog step (e.g. `↓` if you were closing) and mark at
   *that* cursor instead. Marking against the stop bakes a stalling endpoint into
   every future pose.

6. Press `s` to save at any point, or just `q` / Ctrl+C — the script saves on
   exit too. Saving writes **only the active finger's** `limits` block; the rest
   of the YAML (other fingers, serial settings) is preserved untouched.

7. **The ordering guard.** A limit set is only saved if
   `base_min < base_max` **and** `side_min < side_max`. If you've marked them out
   of order (e.g. marked `base_max` while the cursor was on the open side), the
   script refuses and tells you which pair is wrong:

   ```
   NOT saved -- invalid limits: base_min (40) >= base_max (10)
   ```

   on `s`, or on exit:

   ```
   NOT saving -- invalid limits: … . Re-run and mark valid endpoints.
   ```

   The YAML is left unchanged in that case — re-run and re-mark. (Because the run
   starts from the *stored* limits, any extreme you never marked keeps its prior
   value, so you can also fix just one bad limit by re-running and re-marking only
   that one.)

8. Repeat 4.3 for all four fingers. Each run handles exactly one finger.

#### 4.4 Verify

Open `hand_calib_values.yaml` and confirm each finger's `limits` block now
holds your measured numbers (no longer the `-30 / 110 / -40 / 40` seeds), and
that within each block `base_min < base_max` and `side_min < side_max`. These
limits are what the audit scripts (Step 5/6) and `hand.kinematics` clamp against.

### Step 5 — Audit with FingerTest

**Script:** `scripts/calibration/amazing_hand/finger_test.py`

Sanity check the saved values against the real mechanism. The finger is walked
through its full calibrated envelope on **both** degrees of freedom: flexion
(`base_max`↔`base_min` at neutral spread), then abduction (`side_max`↔`side_min`
at neutral flexion), returning through neutral between phases.

1. Run (`uv run python scripts/calibration/amazing_hand/finger_test.py`), enter a finger.
2. The finger cycles indefinitely, driving to each calibrated limit in turn. Each
   pose it moves to is printed (e.g. `-> close (full flexion) (base=110, side=0)`).
3. Watch for:
   - Clean flexion endpoints — full close with horns aligned to their servos'
     middle plane, full open returning to neutral.
   - Symmetric abduction — the spread reaches comparable extents either way and
     returns cleanly to center.
   - No buzz, whine, or heat at any endpoint.
4. Ctrl+C to stop; re-run for the next finger.

If a flexion endpoint looks off, revisit Step 3 (middle position). If a limit is
reached early/late or buzzes, revisit Step 4 (range) for that finger.

### Step 6 — Full-hand demo

**Script:** `scripts/calibration/amazing_hand/full_hand_test.py`

This script provides a combined "fist → open hand → per-finger isolation" demo. It reads from `hand_calib_values.yaml` and drives the right hand through a complete cycle.

1. Run the script (`uv run python scripts/calibration/amazing_hand/full_hand_test.py`).
2. The hand will cycle through closing all fingers, opening all fingers, and then exercising each finger independently.
3. This is the end-to-end sanity check that proves the calibration matches the real mechanism across all fingers.

### Utility — park the hand open or closed

**Script:** `scripts/calibration/amazing_hand/set_pose.py`

Not a calibration step — a convenience for driving the whole hand to one static
pose and holding it. Every finger goes to `base_min` (open) or `base_max`
(close) at neutral spread, taken from the calibrated `limits`. The hand is held
under torque until you press Enter, then torque releases.

```powershell
uv run python scripts/calibration/amazing_hand/set_pose.py open
uv run python scripts/calibration/amazing_hand/set_pose.py close
uv run python scripts/calibration/amazing_hand/set_pose.py        # prompts open/close
```

### Utility — jog all fingers and save a pose

**Script:** `scripts/calibration/amazing_hand/jog.py`

Not a calibration step — a convenience for posing the whole hand by keyboard and saving
the result. Torque stays ON; you jog each finger within its calibrated limits, then save
the whole-hand pose by name into `src/arm101_hand/data/hand_config.yaml`. Mirrors the arm's `so_arm101/jog.py`.

```powershell
uv run python scripts/calibration/amazing_hand/jog.py
```

Controls: `1`-`4` select finger; arrows jog base/side; `[`/`]` step; `h`/`H` home
finger/all; `s` save (prompts for a name); `q` release torque and exit.

## 4. Where the calibration lives

Measurement-only calibration state lives in `scripts/calibration/amazing_hand/hand_calib_values.yaml` (v3 schema):

```yaml
schema_version: 3
fingers:
  index:
    servo_1: { middle_pos: 0 }
    servo_2: { middle_pos: 0 }
    limits: { base_min: -30, base_max: 110, side_min: -40, side_max: 40 }
  middle:
    servo_1: { middle_pos: 0 }
    servo_2: { middle_pos: 0 }
    limits: { base_min: -30, base_max: 110, side_min: -40, side_max: 40 }
  ring:
    servo_1: { middle_pos: 0 }
    servo_2: { middle_pos: 0 }
    limits: { base_min: -30, base_max: 110, side_min: -40, side_max: 40 }
  thumb:
    servo_1: { middle_pos: 0 }
    servo_2: { middle_pos: 0 }
    limits: { base_min: -30, base_max: 110, side_min: -40, side_max: 40 }
```

- `fingers.<finger>.servo_1` / `servo_2` — per-servo calibrated `middle_pos` (degrees). `servo_1` is the odd-ID (right) servo, `servo_2` is the even-ID (left) servo of the pair. Servo IDs come from the `FINGER_SERVO_IDS` code canon in `src/arm101_hand/config/motor_ids.py` and are not stored in this file.
- `fingers.<finger>.limits` — the per-finger motion envelope in logical frame: `base` (flexion, positive = close) min/max and `side` (abduction/spread) min/max, in degrees relative to the calibrated middle. Measured by `range_calib.py` (Step 4) and consumed by the audit scripts + kinematics.

**Connection and motion settings** (`com_port`, `baudrate`, `timeout`, `speed`, `speeds`) are **not** in this file. They live in `src/arm101_hand/data/hand_config.yaml` under `connection` and `tuning`. Edit that file to change the port or speed.

The scripts load and save this file through the typed `HandCalibration` schema (`extra='forbid'`), so the recognized fields are validated; hand edits to those fields are fine, but unknown top-level keys are rejected.

## 6. One-line summary

Burn unique IDs (FD.exe) → reset each finger's motors to 0° and install horns (`motor_reset.py`) → interactively dial in per-servo offsets (`middle_calib.py`) → measure per-finger motion limits (`range_calib.py`) → audit per-finger with `finger_test.py` → run the full-hand demo (`full_hand_test.py`). All state lives in `hand_calib_values.yaml`.
