"""Shared setup glue for the SO-ARM101 verify/audit helper scripts.

Device/bus constructors, path constants, AND the exit motion helpers
(``confirm_and_release`` / ``_drive_home``) now live in
``arm101_hand.scripts.device_setup`` (shared with ``scripts/diagnostics/`` and
``scripts/demos/``) and are re-exported here so the arm scripts' ``from _common
import ...`` keeps working unchanged.

IL-3: motors 1-5 only (no gripper ID 6). IL-4: callers own the bus for the
duration of one script run. IL-5: reads ``so101_follower.json``; never writes it.
