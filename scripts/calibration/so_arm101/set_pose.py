"""Drive the SO-ARM101 to a named pose (degrees) and hold it under torque until Enter.

Poses come from src/arm101_hand/data/arm_config.yaml ``poses`` (home -- the folded storage
pose -- plus any poses saved via jog.py). Targets are in DEGREES relative to each joint's
calibrated mid. An out-of-range value is warned and that joint is skipped.

After connect() the script pushes the on-file calibration to the motors so degree targets
physically match the recorded range (writes the MOTORS, never the JSON -- IL-5).

On exit (Enter, Ctrl+C, or EOF) the script never auto-homes a held pose. For any pose except
'home' it prompts: type 'h' to drive back to home first, or just Enter to release torque in
place (the arm sags under gravity from a raised pose). When driving to 'home' there is nothing
to return to, so it simply settles at home and releases without prompting. Then torque is off.

Usage:
  uv run python scripts/calibration/so_arm101/set_pose.py home
  uv run python scripts/calibration/so_arm101/set_pose.py        # prompts

IL-3: motors 1-5. IL-4: single bus owner; torque released in finally.
