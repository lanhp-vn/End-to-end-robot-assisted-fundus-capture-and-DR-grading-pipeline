"""Verify the SO-ARM101 calibration by sweeping joints to their calibrated endpoints.

Uses RANGE_M100_100 normalization, so the calibrated range maps to +/-100 with built-in
clamping -- driving to an endpoint is just commanding +/-margin. For each selected joint
the script: sets a gentle Goal_Velocity, enables torque, moves to mid-range (0) first,
then sweeps 0 -> +margin -> -margin -> 0, watching Present_Load for stalls.

After connect() the script pushes the on-file calibration to the motors
(bus.write_calibration) so the normalized endpoints physically match the recorded range
regardless of the motors' current EEPROM offsets. This writes the MOTORS, never the JSON
(IL-5).

On every exit path -- normal completion, Ctrl+C, or an error after torque-on -- the script
never auto-homes. It prompts: type 'h' to drive back to home first, or just Enter to release
torque in place. After a normal sweep each joint is back at mid-range (0); on an early exit a
joint may be mid-sweep, so use 'h' (or park by hand) if needed.

Usage:
  uv run python scripts/calibration/so_arm101/sweep.py shoulder_pan
  uv run python scripts/calibration/so_arm101/sweep.py all --margin 80

IL-3: motors 1-5. IL-4: single bus owner; torque released in finally.
