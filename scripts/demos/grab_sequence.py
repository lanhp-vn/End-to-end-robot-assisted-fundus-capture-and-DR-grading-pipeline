"""Grab demo: stage the SO-ARM101 into its ``grab`` pose, close the AmazingHand,
hold both under torque, and reverse the whole thing on exit.

Forward sequence (each stage position-confirmed -- arm AND hand -- before the next):
  1. shoulder_pan -> base_max (its calibrated upper bound)
  2. shoulder_lift + elbow_flex + wrist_flex + wrist_roll -> grab, AND hand -> pre_grab
     (commanded together, then both polled to completion)
  3. shoulder_pan -> grab
  4. hand fingers -> grab (closes onto the object; stalls -> times out -> continues)

The two devices live on separate buses (arm = 12 V STS3215, hand = 5 V SCS0009) on
different COM ports, so both are held open at once -- no shared rail (IL-1) and one
owner per bus (IL-4).

On exit:
  * plain Enter / Ctrl+C / EOF -> release BOTH in place (no movement); the arm will
    sag from a raised pose -- you are warned at the prompt.
  * 'h' -> run the sequence in REVERSE: hand -> pre_grab, then shoulder_pan -> base_max,
    then the four posture joints -> home, then shoulder_pan -> home, then (arm now at
    home) hand -> open. Each move is position-confirmed. Torque on BOTH buses is always
    cut at the end, even if a leg fails partway through.

Poses come from version-controlled config (IL-5; never written here):
  * arm  -> src/arm101_hand/data/arm_config.yaml ``poses['grab']`` / ``poses['home']``
  * hand -> src/arm101_hand/data/hand_config.yaml ``poses['grab']`` / ``poses['pre_grab']``
            (``open`` is built-in / limits-derived)
