"""Grab demo: drive the SO-ARM101 to its ``grab`` pose, then the AmazingHand to
its ``grab`` pose, hold both under torque, and release on Enter.

Sequence (arm first, then hand): position the wrist with the arm, then close the
hand into its grab. The two devices live on separate buses (arm = 12 V STS3215,
hand = 5 V SCS0009) on different COM ports, so both are held open at once -- no
shared rail (IL-1) and one owner per bus (IL-4).

On exit (Enter, Ctrl+C, or EOF): the arm is holding the raised grab pose and
would sag under gravity if simply released, so ``confirm_and_release`` prompts
'h' to drive it home first or Enter to release in place (both stay gripped during
the prompt). Choosing 'h' also opens the hand (to its ``open`` pose) as the arm
returns home; releasing in place leaves the hand where it is. Then the hand torque
is released. Torque on BOTH buses is always cut, even if one leg fails partway
through.

Poses come from version-controlled config (IL-5; never written here):
  * arm  -> data/arm_config.yaml ``poses['grab']``
  * hand -> data/hand_config.yaml ``poses['grab']``

Usage:
  uv run python scripts/demos/grab_sequence.py
