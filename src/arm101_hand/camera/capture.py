"""Capture-pipeline I/O: wait for the new file to land, then save it + a sidecar.

The new-file wait guards the write race (a file can appear in the filelist before its
bytes are fully flushed) by requiring its size to be nonzero and unchanged across
``stable_polls`` consecutive filelist reads. It also tolerates the Aurora's intermittent
``GET_FILELIST`` CODE_FAIL: a failed poll is reported (not raised) and polling continues,
so a later successful poll within the window still catches the capture.
