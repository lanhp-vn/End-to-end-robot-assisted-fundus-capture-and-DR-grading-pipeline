"""Hand motion helpers: command SCS0009 servos and confirm arrival by position-polling.

Mirrors the arm's ``drive_arm_joints`` position-wait so BOTH devices confirm a move
finished (within tolerance) before the caller proceeds, instead of a blind sleep. A
gripping close that stalls on an object simply times out and continues
(timeout-then-continue) -- these helpers never raise and never hang. All positions are
SCS0009 wire-radians (what ``write_goal_position`` accepts and ``read_present_position``
returns); convert a degree tolerance with ``math.radians`` at the call site.
