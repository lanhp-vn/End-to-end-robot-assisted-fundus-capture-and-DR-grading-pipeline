"""Shared application-layer glue for SO-ARM101 device/bus construction.

Promoted out of ``scripts/calibration/so_arm101/_common.py`` so both the arm
calibration scripts AND the device-neutral ``scripts/diagnostics/`` helpers can
import it without a ``sys.path`` hack. Not pure (loads config + constructs the
robot/bus); the unit-testable calibration math lives in
``arm101_hand.robots.calibration_summary``.

IL-3: motors 1-5 only (no gripper ID 6). IL-4: callers own the bus for the
duration of one run. IL-5: reads ``so101_follower.json``; never writes it.

    to run a fully custom, staged return (e.g. open the hand, then reverse the arm stage by stage).
