"""Live USB observation-camera preview window + record toggle (device layer).

The arm-mounted host webcam that films the Optomed Aurora's screen. Used by
``scripts/demos/grab_trigger_capture.py`` and the ``scripts/diagnostics/system_camera/usb_camera_probe.py``
smoke test. NOT the Aurora fundus camera (that is ``arm101_hand.fundus_camera``).

Needs the full ``opencv-python`` wheel for HighGUI (``cv2.imshow``); the project drops
lerobot's ``opencv-python-headless`` pin in ``pyproject.toml`` (``[tool.uv] override-dependencies``)
so the full build is the sole ``cv2``. Capture + ``VideoWriter`` work headless; only the window
needs GUI.

Threading contract (the part that matters):
  * The capture thread is the ONLY place the cv2 window / capture / writer are touched
    (created, pumped, destroyed). It is a daemon thread, so a caller's blocking
    ``msvcrt.getwch`` keyboard loop on the main thread never freezes the window.
    Because HighGUI is single-threaded, this same thread also hosts the optional
    "last capture" still window (see :meth:`show_still`) -- callers never touch cv2.
  * Callers interact ONLY through :meth:`start`, :meth:`toggle_record`, :meth:`show_still`,
    :meth:`stop`.
  * Recording is requested via a thread-safe Event; the capture thread owns the writer
    and reacts to it -- the ``VideoWriter`` is created lazily from a real captured frame
    (size + fps), and the CLEAN frame is written BEFORE any on-screen overlay.
  * ALL teardown (writer + capture + ``destroyAllWindows``) runs on the capture thread,
    triggered by a stop Event that :meth:`stop` sets then joins.

Best-effort by design: if the camera index will not open, :meth:`start` returns ``False``
and the caller continues without a preview (the camera/grab workflow is the priority).
